I. The Duke Community Standard Duke University is a community of scholars and learners, committed to the principles of honesty, trustworthiness, fairness, and respect for others. Students share with faculty and staff the responsibility for promoting a climate of integrity. As citizens of this community, students are expected to adhere to these fundamental values at all times, in both their academic and non-academic endeavors.

The Pledge Students affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:

I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.

I will conduct myself responsibly and honorably in all my activities as a Duke student.

The Reaffirmation Upon completion of each academic assignment, students will be expected to reaffirm the above commitment by signing this statement: “I have adhered to the Duke Community Standard in completing this assignment.” -John Sipp
